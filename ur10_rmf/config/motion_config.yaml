# Created by: YouLiang
# Date: Dec 2018
# Description: Motion Descriptor for UR10 motion control
#
# * Type: Joint goal and pose goal -> Absolute value
#         Cartesian planning -> Relative position
# * TimeFactor: Duration of motion increases (speed decreases) when factor inceases
#
# rest2 -> cabinet ->bev machine -> robot -> rest2
# G1 -> G9 -> G10 -> G7 -> G6
